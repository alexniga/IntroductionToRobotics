## Game idea: 
            "Dancing joystick" where the arrows on the matrix show you the dance moves ^^ (the directions where to lean the joytick).

## HW components: 
            -Arduino Uno
            -LCD Display
            -Joystick
            -8*8 Led Matrix

## Game brief introduction:
            - On the matrix there are 9 arrows that shows where to lean the joystick
            - On the LCD Display we have the menu (Start game, Settings, HighScore) and for every choise it's caracteristics
            - During the game the LCD dispaly the level, score and lives

## How to play:

   After you start the game, in 3 seconds it will show you one or more arrows on the matrix, depending on the level selected in the settings. 
The arrow on the matrix indicates the direction where you have to lean the joystick:

            - For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick UP.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick DOWN.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick to the RIGHT.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick to the LEFT.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick to the TOP LEFT CORNER.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to lean the joystick to the BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER.

            -For this out-put on the matrix, you would have to push the joystick BUTTON.

            If you will do all the moves corectlly, then you will get an "O" on the matrix like this witch means that you finished the level

            If you will a mistake during the level, then you will get an "X" on the matrix like this
